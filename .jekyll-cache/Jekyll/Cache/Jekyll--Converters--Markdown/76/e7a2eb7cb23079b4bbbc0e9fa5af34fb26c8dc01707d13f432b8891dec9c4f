<ul>
  <li>Your results from today are not from today.</li>
  <li>Results are an accumulation of tiny choices over time.</li>
  <li>Choose the option that will make your future self better.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of it like this. You are from the future who time traveled to the present to make your future self better.</p>
