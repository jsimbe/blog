  <li><strong>How</strong> you practice is just as important as <strong>how much</strong> you practice</li>
  <li>practice should be goalless</li>
  <li>learn to love the plateau</li>
  <li>focus on the process, not the product</li>
  <li>do not judge the results</li>
  <li>practice for the sake of practicing</li>
  <li>the skill is practicing the goal, not having the goal</li>
  <li>Judging your work is a waste of energy</li>
  <li>As we practice things, even though it feels like we are making no progress at all, we are turning new behaviors into habits. Learning is happening all along. Just keep practicing even when you seem to be getting nowhere</li>
  <li>The anti-mastery mentality is focused on quick fixes.</li>
  <li>Practice is dedicated effort without attachment to immediate results</li>
  <li>One benefit of learning slowly: it forces you to look deeply at the process and you discover incremental steps that you might otherwise gloss over if progress came easily.</li>
  <li>The essence of boredom is to be found in the obsessive search for novelty. Satisfaction lies in mindful repetition, the discovery of endless richness as subtle variations on familiar themes.</li>
  <li>Rewards will always come to someone who commits to the practice, but the rewards are not the goal. The practice is the goal.</li>
  <li>Mastery is not about perfection. It’s about the process.</li>
  <li>If you want to truly master something, you must be willing to remain a beginner and look a fool. The beginner’s mind is required for learning anything new.</li>
  <li>The gain is too small to focus on it. Instead, focus on the behavior, the everyday practice. Do not be driven by the gain.</li>
  <li>The real joy comes from growth and progress. not from getting a result</li>
  <li>Ask yourself, “How can I make today better than yesterday?”</li>
