I"¾<p>Do not quit because it is difficult. It is supposed to be difficult. You are supposed to suck at the start. There is no easy way. The value lies in its difficulty. If it is difficult for you, it is also difficult for everybody else. If you feel pain and discomfort, others also felt pain when starting out. Do not quit because you are in pain. Instead, get a reward from it. Prove to yourself that you can do it.</p>

<p>Think of Max Park as an example. He is the world champion. The world record holder for many events. He has autism. How difficult is it for him to do those? Maybe twice, three times as hard. Yet, he still was able to do it.</p>

<p>If others have done it, you can do it too.</p>
