Say you are driving. You have a destination in mind. But as you drive, you do not imagine being on the endpoint. You are focused on the road in front of you. You may look forward a bit to see if you need to turn. But you do not look so much ahead in the future. You only process what is visible at the current moment. And as you move forward, incrementally, you process the next visible area. Bit by bit, until you arrive at your destination.
